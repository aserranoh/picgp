# Overview

picgp is a programmer for Microchip PIC microcontrollers that uses the
computer's GPIO port to download the program into the microcontroller.

# Building and Installing picgp

To build and install picgp, just execute the command:

    sudo python setup.py install

# Usage

For example, if you have the Vpp pin connectec to the GPIO pin 18, PGC to the
23 and PGD to the 24, and you want to download the file text.hex into your
pic18f2550, you could execute this command:

    picgp -p p18f26j13 -C 23 -D 24 -V 18 test.hex

If you want to use the Low Voltage Programming mode available in some
processors, you have to give as well the PGM pin using the option -M.

Some options can also be included in the file $HOME/.picgp.conf to avoid
writing them every time you execute the command. For example, the possible
contents of this file may be:

    pgc=23
    pgd=24
    vpp=18
    processor=p18f26j13

Then, the above command would become:

    picgp test.hex

See the man page available for the complete list of options.
Use the option -l to see the complete list of supported processors.

# Notes

Beware that if you want to use the High Voltage Programming mode available
in some processors, you cannot connect the vpp GPIO pin direct to the Vpp
processor pin. You must use it to drive some circuit to feed 11 or 12 V to
the Vpp/MCLR pin (for example using an open collector identity gate).

This program accesses the GPIO through the sysfs interface provided by the
Linux kernel. Normal users don't have permissions to access the GPIO interface
in sysfs by default. So in order to use picgp either the administrator
provides a way for a normal user to access this interface (for example using
udev to modify the default permissions in the sysfs files), or picgp is
executed as superuser.
